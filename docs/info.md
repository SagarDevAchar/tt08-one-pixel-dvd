## How it works

- Uses the [HVSync Generator from TinyTapeout](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/vga-playground/blob/main/src/examples/common/hvsync_generator.v)
- Keeps track of pixel position and directions and flips them when necessary
- Smart idea by RebelMike to divide the Horizontal Timing by 16 to save the number of flops used!

## External hardware

- [Leo's TinyVGA Pmod](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga) connected to OUTPUT terminal (`uo_out`)
- Some switches to the INPUT terminal (`ui_in`)

## How to test

- Connect the necessary peripherals
- Provide a 25MHz clock to the top module `tt_um_micro_one_pixel_dvd_sda`
- Set input bits 7 and 6 to choose the starting direction of movement
- Reset the design
- Enjoy the show :)
- Tweak the inputs to change your colours!
